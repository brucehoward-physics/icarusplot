`icarusplot`

Style files and functionality to aid in the creation of plots in ICARUS. Currently only implemented in Python. To use it, go to this directory and `source setup_style.sh`. This sets up icarusplot in 
your PYTHONPATH, so that you can `import icarusplot` or `from icarusplot import *` or etc. and use the utilities.

Current "maintainers" of this repository are Bruce Howard, Jaesung Kim, and Justin Mueller.

Parts of the design, e.g. the mplstyle file or bolding of the experiment name etc., are based heavily on the DUNE style file located at: https://github.com/DUNE/dune_plot_style
